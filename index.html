			<h2>FPV Drones in Jamaica</h2>

				First Person View drones, or FPV drones, joined the aviation hobby 
				around 2013 and became popular amongst hobbyist in 2015. Though it 
				has become 'popular', the most common form of drones around the world  
				especially Jamaica are those which are flown using line of sight and 
				some with a screen. It is uncommon for one to build a drone, and more 
				common for someone to puchase a commercially ready to fly drone which 
				requires little to no assembly from brands such as DJI, which is the 
				most popular drone building company worldwide. <br> <br>
				In Jamaica, there are only a handful of persons that can say they are 
				apart of the hobby, and many that are unaware of the enjoyment to be 
				had, the technical aspects and learning opportunities for the youth of 
				our society and even the young at heart. 
				Some in our society will be able to see the light to our hobby and the 
				enjoyment to be had, while others may see the security risks that may 
				be introduced, but with proper understanding of the hobby and with 
				reasonable laws implemented everyone whether observers or pilots can 
				enjoy the hobby. <br>

			<h2>Effects of Rain on Drones</h2>

			<p>
				Rain can have a significant impact on the performance and longevity of
 				quadcopters (or drones). Flying in the rain introduces moisture into the 
				delicate electronic components of the quad, such as the motors, flight 
				controller, and camera. Water can short-circuit the electronics, leading 
				to malfunction or permanent damage. Additionally, rain adds weight to the 
				drone and affects its aerodynamics, reducing its ability to maintain stable 
				flight. This can make it difficult to control, especially for FPV (First-Person 
				View) flying, where visibility through a water-splattered camera lens is compromised.<br><br>
				Furthermore, rain can interfere with the radio signals between the quad and 
				its controller, potentially causing signal loss or increased latency. This 
				is particularly dangerous for FPV quads, as losing connection mid-flight could 
				result in crashes or the quad becoming unrecoverable. Despite some waterproofing 
				options or conformal coatings, it's always risky to fly in rainy conditions unless 
				the drone is specifically designed to withstand such environments. In general, 
				flying quads in rain should be avoided to protect your gear and ensure safety.<br>

		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
			I recently became a FPV Drone pilot 
			with approximately 60 hours of simulation 
			flight time, and 1.5 hours of real life 
			flight time. I am currently in my second 
			year of university for computer science.
